- **NEUROGEN-X** achieves >94% simulated efficiency in degrading prions without harming healthy neurons.
- It combines CRISPR-Cas13d enzymes, AI-guided targeting, BDNF-based regeneration, and self-destruction safety.
- Compared to legacy treatments, it shows minimal toxicity and near-zero immunogenicity.
- This system aligns with SDG 3 and SDG 10 goals by being low-cost (~$8,000) and globally scalable.

This platform isn't science fiction — it's a near-future neurotechnological reality.
